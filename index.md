# Julia Saltzman 
## Quantitative Tools for Marine Conservation 

###About Me 
Hello! My name is Julia Saltzman. I consider myself a conservation biologist. My current research focuses on the population monitoring and modelling of shark and ray populations in the Easten Tropical Pacific. I am currently a masters student in Dr. Easton White's Quantitative Marine Ecology Lab at the University of New Hampshire. I am is an interdisciplinary marine conservation biologist. I graduated from the University of Miami in 2021 with her bachelor’s in marine science, biology, and ecosystem science and policy. At University of Miami, I worked in the Shark Research and Conservation Lab where her research focused on the impacts of prey quality and quantity on shark abundance and movements. Most recently, I worked under Dr. Catherine Macdonald at Field School conducting research on Atlantic tarpon. During her time at University of Miami, I received the Linda Farmer Fellowship and Mastraini Award to start up her work monitoring Atlantic tarpon. Julia is passionate education and outreach and is currently working with Terranaut Club, where she helps to bring girls and underrepresented genders to the forefront of exciting, hands-on, immersive experiences in science and nature. I work closely with Laurel School, an all-girls school in Ohio, where she serves as a mentor for high school students in their capstone program.
