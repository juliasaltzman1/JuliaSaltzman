### _Non Invasive Tools_

I am interested in using novel and noninvasive tools to study species and ecosystems which are logistically difficult and costly to study. 

#### Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
_Using drones, I study the behavior, specifically the aggregations of Atlantic tarpon off the Coast of Miami. This is a figure from Saltzman et al. 2021, which is in prep for submission to Southeastern Naturalist._
